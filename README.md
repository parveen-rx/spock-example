# Spock Example Project

Welcome to the Spock Example Project! This repository contains example specifications and build scripts for Gradle to help you get started with Spock.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or later
- Gradle (use `gradlew` wrapper)
- Grails 6.2.0 or later

## Getting Started

### Building with Gradle

To build the project using Gradle, run the following command:

```
./gradlew clean
```

Downloaded files, including the Gradle distribution itself, will be stored in the Gradle user home directory (typically `user_home/.gradle`).

## IDE Integration

### Creating an IDEA Project

Just open the project directory (open build.gradle as project) with IntelliJ IDEA, and it should auto-detect the project settings.

### Running Tests with Gradle

To run the project test cases using Gradle, run the following command:

```
./gradlew test
```
